          '\n<p>Move over, baseball, there’s a new game in town.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As the dangers of the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-update-us-sketches-out-economys-reopen-but-testing-a-big-worry-182002455.html">coronavirus pandemic</a> keep U.S. sports and entertainment venues shuttered and millions of Americans at home, baking is having its moment.</p>\n<p>“Baking is the new baseball,”<a href="https://www.kingarthurflour.com/">King Arthur Flour</a> co-CEO Karen Colberg told Yahoo Finance. ”It\'s become a national pastime.”</p>\n<p>As countless new homebodies rediscover the therapeutic joys of cooking, Colberg explained that “people are baking a lot. Initially, you\'re thinking people are pantry-loading; they\'re kind of fearful, not sure what\'s going to come. But we\'re seeing a lot of baking happening too.”</p>\n<p>The numbers tell it all: In the United States, for the week ending April 12, sales of yeast were up more than 300 percent from an average week in 2019, according to market research firm Nielsen.</p>\n<p>In that same week, sales of baking cocoa and parchment paper had roughly doubled. In France — the baguette capital of the world — sales of flour more than doubled in the month of March versus the comparable time frame last year.</p>\n<h2>‘We’re at full tilt’</h2>\n<figure>\n <img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-04/15fa5190-8173-11ea-9fbf-40617bca336c" alt="In this Monday, Aug. 27, 2013 photo, flour lines the shelves at King Arthur Flour Co. in Norwich, Vt.

(AP Photo/Toby Talbot)\n </figcaption> \n</img></figure>\n<p>King Arthur Flour’s corporate history dates back almost 300 years, and it’s seeing an unprecedented rush on its own coveted bags of flour. In the last three weeks, demand has tripled over what the company normally expects this time of year.</p>\n<p>To meet the surge, King Arthur Flour has its mills running at full capacity, and has even added another mill to the production line. “We are at full tilt,” Colberg said. “We’ve worked with our partners to get to 24/7 production. And I think that customers will continue to see in and out of stocks over the next couple of months as we ramp, because we\'re foreseeing some sustained demand for a while.”</p>\n<p>Like so many companies, King Arthur is scrambling to shift its supply chain. It has plenty of bulk flour in 50 pound bags, especially now that so many restaurants and food service customers are temporarily closed. The trick, however, is getting that flour into smaller retail bags.</p>\n<p>“There\'s plenty of wheat out there,” Colberg told Yahoo Finance.</p>\n<p>“But the milling capacity, the bagging capacity is very different for the baker / foodservice business than the retail business,” she said. “And you can\'t just kind of flip the switch and say, ‘Hey, let\'s get the five pounders over there,’ unfortunately.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As the company works to get more flour, yeast and other baking ingredients into the hands of home bakers, King Arthur is feeding their customers’ curiosity with loads of tips and recipes on its <a href="https://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog">website</a>, and a new video series called “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/kingarthurflour/">The Isolation Baking Show</a>” on Facebook.</p>\n<p>“Whether you\'ve never picked up a whisk or you\'re a professional baker, you\'re home. And you need something to do,” Colberg said. “(Baking) a huge source of comfort. And it\'s a creative outlet.”</p>\n<figure>\n <img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-04/fd7f3f30-80f1-11ea-bbf7-e729a477f5d9" alt="Amid the coronavirus pandemic, countless people are finding comfort in baking." credit="poplasen via Getty Images" crediturl="" width="7015" height="4682" data-ops=""> \n <figcaption>\n  Amid the coronavirus pandemic, countless people are finding comfort in baking. (Photo: Getty)\n </figcaption> \n</img></figure>\n<h2>‘It’s comforting’</h2>\n<p>Lifelong amateur baker Amy Holt has been baking up a storm as she shelters in place in her Cape Cod home with her husband and their 27 year-old daughter.</p>\n<p>“It’s comforting. It warms your house and it’s great to have the nice smell in your home,” she said.</p>\n<p>“For us, it’s relaxing. It’s something we really enjoy. We do it as a family. There’s a lot of tradition behind some of the things we make,” Holt added.</p>\n<p>In the last month, the family has made chocolate babka, corn bread, cranberry and rosemary biscotti with drizzled dark chocolate, jalapeno cheddar soft pretzels, chocolate chip cookies, ginger snaps and more.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Yet it’s been a challenge finding the ingredients, especially as <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grocery-buying-skyrockets-as-coronavirus-prompts-consumers-to-eat-in-rather-than-carry-out-165958388.html">housebound consumers mob grocery stores </a>and stockpile goods. This week, Holt went to three different stores — wearing a face mask and staying a safe six feet from other customers — in search of yeast which she never found.</p>\n<p>The grocery store closest to her home hasn’t had flour (or toilet paper) in more than a month. So, on a recent quick trip to Target, she managed to nab two 5-pound bags.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Sugar, flour and yeast are very difficult to find,” she said. “When you see them, you buy them.”</p>\n<p><em>Karen Colberg, King Arthur Flour co-CEO, was interviewed on Yahoo Finance’s </em><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/show/finalround"><em>The Final Round</em></a><em>, which airs Monday through Friday 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. ET.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Read more of our&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/coronavirus"><strong>coronavirus coverage</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>\n<ul> \n <li><p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-news-live-april-17-2020-221218382.html"><strong>Stock market news live updates: Dow rally on coronavirus treatment optimism, reopening talk</strong></a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-doctor-fighting-the-coronavirus-in-his-own-special-way-134604603.html"><strong>The doctor fighting the coronavirus in his own special way</strong></a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/what-to-watch-in-these-trying-times-tony-hales-archibalds-next-big-thing-on-netflix-182601974.html"><strong>What to watch in these trying times: Tony Hale’s ‘Archibald’s Next Big Thing’ on Netflix</strong></a></p></li> \n</ul>\n<p><em>Follow Yahoo Finance on&nbsp;</em><a href="https://twitter.com/YahooFinance"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/yahoofinance/"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/yahoofinance/?hl=en"><em>Instagram</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://flipboard.com/topic/yahoofinance"><em>Flipboard</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://b.smartnews.be/sr/22KpZt3f1a6FAmNimBiSnzqADfTE1m2w3q3o69J"><em>SmartNews</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/yahoo-finance"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href="http://youtube.com/c/yahoofinance?sub_confirmation=1"><em>YouTube</em></a><em>, and&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yahoofinance/"><em>reddit</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>',

          '\n<p>Robots are graduating from college.</p>\n<p>At least that was the scene at Japan’s BBT University earlier this month as telepresence robots donning cap and gown filled in for students walking the commencement stage to receive their diplomas during the coronavirus lockdown. Digital tablets strapped to robot faces featured the faces of real graduates on a video call in an attempt to experience the moment firsthand.</p>\n<span> \n <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n  <p>Telepresence robots draped in caps and gowns took the place of graduating students at Japan\'s BBT University and it\'s officially the saddest commencement I\'ve ever seen <a href="https://t.co/XIaVjpJaLD">pic.twitter.com/XIaVjpJaLD</a></p>— Zack Guzman (@zGuz) \n  <a href="https://twitter.com/zGuz/status/1247974553122308096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 8, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> </span>\n<p>In a similar spirit, many colleges in the U.S. are now scrambling to find similar solutions that could still help students personalize and enjoy their commencement instead of just resorting to sad, cold video conference calls.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One startup that quickly pivoted to help schools do just that is U.K.-based StageClip, a three-year-old company that had originally provided personalized video clips of students’ names being read during what could be hours-long commencement ceremonies. With those ceremonies quickly morphing into virtual video streams, the company flipped its model on its head to let students upload clips of themselves in cap and gown.</p>\n<p>“Twenty-five days ago, all our events were wiped out,” StageClips CEO Rupert Forsythe told Yahoo Finance’s YFi PM. “We scratched our heads and got together and said, ‘That\'s what we were doing before. We need to reverse it and use user-generated content and allow these guys to create virtual processions.’”</p>\n<figure>\n <img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/1d4c53e0-8136-11ea-b55a-6367181b192b" alt="StageClip also allows students to upload videos using SnapChat filters that make them appear as if they are wearing a cap and gown. (StageClip)" credit="Yahoo Finance" crediturl="" width="3282" height="1840" data-ops=""> \n <figcaption>\n  StageClip also allows students to upload videos using SnapChat filters that make them appear as if they are wearing a cap and gown. (StageClip)\n </figcaption> \n</img></figure>\n<p>Now, selfies from students at participating universities are flooding in, being sent in preparation for ceremonies to be held at Arizona State, Georgetown, Rutgers, and Harvard’s School of Public Health, among many others. The company even signed up more than 50 high schools and partnered with graduation memorabilia company Herff Jones, a division of Varsity Brands, to get matching caps and gowns to students for selfies ahead of time. Pairing that individual content with speeches and university logos might not completely replicate what many students consider to be their crowning achievement, but it’s pretty close, Forsythe says.</p>\n<p>“This isn\'t an in-person event, nothing can replicate that,” he said. “But what these institutions can do is they can celebrate a moment, give individual recognition and create a communal event online.”</p>\n<p>Weeks ago, when Forsythe was pitching his virtual commencement strategy to college administrators, he hosted a conference call with more than 1,700 representatives. Almost immediately the phone started ringing off the hook with his sales team piling up more than $2.5 million in a matter of weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“We were flooded with requests, that\'s when we knew we have to do something about it,” he said, adding that his team went into overdrive booking 18-hour days for days at a time getting the platform up and running to meet the vision of what his team had pitched. “I\'m a big believer in talking about content first and being able to build the technology.”</p>\n<p>When asked to compare his idea of letting students personalize their special day with videos rather than getting beamed across the commencement stage as a robot, Forsythe laughed and applauded both solutions.</p>\n<p>“I saw that clip actually earlier in the week,” he laughed. “But I think that it’s unfortunately not scalable. But If I could scale it, I would do it.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Zack Guzman is the host of&nbsp;</strong></em><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/show/yfi-pm/"><em><strong>YFi PM</strong></em></a><em><strong>&nbsp;as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.

A similar trend could be seen in <a href="http://ldh.la.gov/Coronavirus/">Louisiana</a>, where fatalities among blacks stood at 59%, compared to 30% of whites.</p>\n<h2>The financial impact</h2>\n<p>And financially, the impacts of coronavirus could be long-lasting. Seven million jobs held by black Americans — a total of 39% — are at risk of temporary or permanent loss and disruption. That’s compared to 34% for whites.</p>\n<p>“This 5 point gap is meaningful especially with the economic fragility of black Americans to begin with. The inability to weather the job disruption,” Stewart said.</p>\n<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, black and Hispanic workers are more than <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/working-poor/2017/home.htm">twice as likely</a> to earn poverty-level wages compared to their white counterparts.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure>\n <img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-04/7950a960-8169-11ea-b7e6-34c78c244568" alt="Hempstead, N.Y.: A man wearing a security guard uniform and a mask due to coronavirus concerns walks down a street carrying groceries in Hempstead, New York on April 8, 2020.

Women of color struggle in particular: 10% of black women and 9% of Hispanic women are classified as the working poor, compared to 3.5% of white men.</p>\n<p>Low-wage workers won’t be the only ones that will be hit financially — so will business owners of color.&nbsp;According to the study, 40% of revenues of black-owned businesses are located in the 5 sectors most vulnerable to coronavirus, including leisure, hospitality, and retail. That’s compared to just 25% of the revenue at risk across all American businesses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Considering that black populations tend to struggle with <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/minorities-pay-more-to-bank-than-whites-report-161950159.html">access to credit</a> and financial services, these financial hits put already vulnerable communities into even more precarious positions.</p>\n<p>“It paints a pretty grim picture,” Stewart said.</p>\n<h2>The long-term effect</h2>\n<p>Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) are among Democrats that have put forth legislation to track the impact of the virus on various demographics, including race and ethnicity.</p>\n<figure>\n <img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-04/be9b0100-8169-11ea-9bee-af1af12e07c5" alt="U.S. Representative Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) introduces Democratic 2020 U.S. presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) at a GOTV campaign event in Concord, New Hampshire, U.S., February 9, 2020.

The tracking is necessary, Stewart explained.</p>\n<p>What’s more, he says, tracking will be critical to ensure that resources are allocated to the most vulnerable populations: regardless of race or ethnicity.</p>\n<p>“The one thing that Americans seem to be in agreement on is that resources are needed to mitigate the worst impact of this crisis. It’s not just about black and brown Americans. We need to understand: ‘Who are the most vulnerable populations?’” he said.</p>\n<p>And once the pandemic ends, it’s unknown how long communities of color will feel the impact.</p>\n<p>“I’m quite concerned,” Stewart explained. “What we’ve seen in prior downturns is that black Americans tend to recover more slowly than the broader economy. We know on average black Americans have 5 days worth of liquid savings compared to 31 days of white Americans. That liquidity speaks to the ability to weather the storm.”</p>\n<p><em>Kristin Myers is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        summary:
          'President Donald Trump on Friday announced a $19 billion relief program to help U.S. farmers cope with the impact of the coronavirus, including $16 billion in direct payments to producers and mass purchases of meat, dairy, vegetables and other products.  The U.S. Agriculture Department is partnering with regional and local distributors to purchase $3 billion in such farm goods to be distributed to food banks, churches and aid groups as millions of Americans face unemployment with much of the economy shut down.  "American agriculture has been hard-hit, like most of America, with the coronavirus, and President Trump is standing with our farmers and all Americans to make sure that we all get through this national emergency," Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said at a White House news conference.',

          '<p>By P.J. Huffstutter and Karl Plume</p> \n<p>CHICAGO (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday announced a $19 billion relief program to help U.S. farmers cope with the impact of the coronavirus, including $16 billion in direct payments to producers and mass purchases of meat, dairy, vegetables and other products.</p> \n<p>The U.S. Agriculture Department is partnering with regional and local distributors to purchase $3 billion in such farm goods to be distributed to food banks, churches and aid groups as millions of Americans face unemployment with much of the economy shut down. </p> \n<p>"American agriculture has been hard-hit, like most of America, with the coronavirus, and President Trump is standing with our farmers and all Americans to make sure that we all get through this national emergency," Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said at a White House news conference.</p> \n<p>The agency said it will make monthly purchases totaling about $100 million each of fresh produce, dairy products and meat products. Perdue said USDA will work with companies like Sysco Corp to help procure, package and distribute food boxes. </p> \n<p>Long lines have formed at U.S. food banks in recent weeks. </p> \n<p>Farmers and ranchers have struggled to get their goods to market because of disruption caused by the pandemic, forcing some to throw out food and call for government help.</p> \n<p>"Having to dump milk or plow under vegetables ready to market is not only financially distressing but it\'s heartbreaking as well for those that produce them," Perdue said.</p> \n<p>Direct payments will be sent "as quickly as possible" as farm commodity producers have experienced "unprecedented losses," Perdue said, who hoped checks could be sent by the end of May.</p> \n<p>The $16 billion in direct payments to farmers and ranchers will include $9.6 billion for the livestock industry - with $5.1 billion for cattle, $2.9 billion for dairy and $1.6 billion for hogs, according to a statement released late Friday by U.S. Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee.</p> \n<p>In addition, $3.9 billion will be paid to row crop producers, $2.1 billion for specialty crop farmers and $500 million for other crops, according to the statement. The payments are capped at $250,000 per individual farmer or entity.</p> \n<p>The Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), which represents corn-based ethanol producers that have suffered due to lack of demand for motor fuels as Americans stay home, was quick to criticize the package. </p> \n<p>"USDA missed a crucial opportunity to lend a helping hand to an industry that is suffering the worst economic crisis in its history," RFA President Geoff Cooper said in a statement. </p> \n<p>Perdue acknowledged that constituents may consider the direct payments "insufficient” and said USDA is trying to cover "small farmers as well as larger farmers.” </p> \n<p>Funding for the immediate aid program will be pulled together from a number of sources, including recent coronavirus-related aid laws passed by Congress and other funding authorities that USDA has access to, according to Perdue.</p> \n<p>But going forward, he said, "I anticipate we will need additional money."</p> \n<p> </p>\n<p> (Additional reporting by Steve Holland, Makini Brice and Humeyra Pamuk in Washington; Editing by Leslie Adler and Daniel Wallis)</p>',

          '\n<p>Before New York Governor Andrew Cuomo finished his <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/andrew-cuomo-new-york-governor-coronavirus-update-briefing-watch-live-stream-today-2020-04-17/">daily coronavirus press briefing</a> on Friday afternoon, his remarks had elicited <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251181563506757632">a sharply critical tweet from President Donald Trump</a>. That came hours after Trump had sent a series of <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169987110330372">tweets</a> calling to “LIBERATE” Virginia, Minnesota, and Michigan — all states led by Democratic governors.</p>\n<p>In a newly released interview, taped on March 16, Recode co-founder and <a href="https://talkingbiznews.com/they-talk-biz-news/pivot-podcast-joins-new-york-magazine-swisher-to-be-editor-at-large/">newly appointed New York Magazine Editor-at-Large</a> Kara Swisher called Trump an “epic troll,” saying his use of Twitter (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR/">TWTR</a>) to spread misinformation has hampered the federal response to the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-update-us-sketches-out-economys-reopen-but-testing-a-big-worry-182002455.html">coronavirus outbreak</a> and put lives at risk.</p>\n<p>“It\'s a dangerous tool in his hands,” she says of Trump, who has 77.4 million followers on the platform. “This whole crisis has sort of been a backlash to that.”</p>\n<figure>\n <img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-04/5846b3d0-8165-11ea-bdff-4a444a73fe81" alt="NEW YORK, NEW YORK - NOVEMBER 06: Kara Swisher, Contributing Opinion Writer, The New York Times speaks at 2019 New York Times Dealbook on November 06, 2019 in New York City.

And when he\'s lying about actual science, it\'s a problem.”</p>\n<h2>‘Very much under control’</h2>\n<p>Trump spread a number of false or misleading statements on Twitter in recent weeks. On Feb. 24, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1232058127740174339">he tweeted</a>: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA.” On that day, the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-02-24-20-hnk-intl/index.html">Centers for Disease Control reported 53 confirmed cases</a> of coronavirus in the U.S.; as of Saturday morning, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. rose to more than 706,000, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">Johns Hopkins University</a></p>\n<p>On March 9, Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/9/21171582/coronavirus-trump-tweets-stock-market-denial">posted two misleading tweets</a> that blamed a market plunge on an oil price war and “Fake News,” and emphasized the comparatively small number of deaths caused by the coronavirus as opposed to the seasonal flu. Around the world, roughly 6.4% of people infected with the coronavirus have died worldwide, though that death rate is like an over-count, as deaths are easier to track than infections, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-death-rate.html">the New York Times reported</a>.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the mortality rate of the coronavirus is thought to be higher than that of the seasonal flu, which kills 0.1% of infected individuals, <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-disease-2019-vs-the-flu">Johns Hopkins University says</a>.</p>\n<p>Less than two weeks after the March 9 tweets, Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1241367239900778501">tweeted</a> that a combination of anti-malaria medicine hydroxychloroquine and antibiotic azithromycin “have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changes in the history of medicine.”</p>\n<p>His assertion appeared to rely on the results from a small <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300996">French study</a> of 26 COVID-19 patients, but <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3724167#.XpoWAVNKg_V">a review published by scientists in the United Kingdom and Ireland</a> criticized the study’s lack of randomized groups of test subjects. Meanwhile, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/03/coronavirus-fauci-warns-americans-shouldnt-assume-hydroxychloroquine-is-a-knockout-drug.html">researchers still need to conduct “definitive studies”</a> on this potential treatment and others.</p>\n<p>Four days after Trump’s tweet about the mixture of anti-malaria medication, an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/health/arizona-coronavirus-chloroquine-death/index.html">Arizona man died</a> after he took a non-pharmaceutical version of chloroquine phosphate to protect himself from the novel coronavirus. His wife said the couple learned of chloroquine as a potential treatment of coronavirus from Trump, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/health/arizona-coronavirus-chloroquine-death/index.html">CNN reported</a>.</p>\n<h2>‘He’s very good at it’</h2>\n<p>Public figures, like Trump, can post hateful or misleading remarks on Twitter if the messages are deemed newsworthy and do not violate <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2019/worldleaders2019.html">a set of conditions outlined by the company last October</a>. Among the violations that could result in “enforcement action” from the company for public figures are “promotion of terrorism,” “direct threats of violence against an individual,” and “promoting self harm,” <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2019/worldleaders2019.html">the company says</a>.</p>\n<p>Swisher pointed out the exemption afforded to Trump on the platform, and in her view how effectively he takes advantage of it.</p>\n<p>“He\'s an epic troll,” Swisher says. “Just appalling behavior on Twitter, and he breaks the rules almost continually that I can tell. But he\'s allowed to because he\'s a newsworthy figure.”</p>\n<p>‘He\'s very good at it,” she adds. “As FDR is to radio and JFK is to TV, he is to Twitter.”</p>\n\n<p>Swisher made the remarks during a conversation that aired in an episode of Yahoo Finance’s “<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/live/influencers/">Influencers with Andy Serwer</a>,” a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.</p>\n<p>In 2014, Swisher co-founded digital tech outlet&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/recode">Recode</a>, after working as a reporter at the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-recode-sold-to-vox-2015-6">Vox Media acquired Recode the following year</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/business/media/vox-buys-nymag.html">last year Vox took ownership of New York Magazine</a>.

Last January, after <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/twitter-troll-shares-old-video-of-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-young-happy-and-dancing/">critics questioned her credibility by posting an old video of her dancing</a>, Ocasio-Cortez mocked the effort by <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1081234130841600000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1081234130841600000&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2019%2Ffeb%2F12%2Falexandria-ocasio-cortez-twitter-social-media">tweeting a video of her dancing outside her Congressional office</a>.</p>\n<p>“She\'s fantastic,” Swisher says of Ocasio-Cortez, who has 6.7 million followers on the platform. “She\'s different than him. He\'s sort of a broadcaster — it\'s like someone screaming with a bullhorn at you.”</p>\n<p>“She\'s a more call and response kind of person,” Swisher adds. “She speaks internet — you know, she speaks Twitter.”</p>\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong></p>\n<ul> \n <li><p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/connecticut-gov-calls-on-trump-to-impose-nationwide-shelterinplace-order-195658746.html"><strong>Connecticut Gov. calls on Trump to impose nationwide shelter-in-place order</strong></a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/workers-condemn-sick-leave-loophole-in-coronavirus-bill-194622494.html"><strong>Workers condemn coronavirus relief bill\'s loophole for big companies</strong></a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-google-amazon-apple-state-lobbying-170525755.html"><strong>Exclusive: \'Ready to stomp on it\': Documents reveal staggering power of tech giant lobbying</strong></a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/"><strong>Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance</strong></a></p></li> \n</ul>\n<p></p>',

          '\n<p>Sen. Ted Cruz warned in an interview on Friday that the U.S. will “see human lives lost” if the economic lockdown to contain the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-update-us-sketches-out-economys-reopen-but-testing-a-big-worry-182002455.html">novel coronavirus</a> outbreak lasts for months instead of weeks. “We are going to see real devastation from poverty to dreams shattered to family businesses put out of business,” the Texas Republican told Yahoo Finance.</p>\n<p>Still, Cruz has pointed out in recent interviews that the ability to open is tied to a state’s capacity to contain the coronavirus. “No one in their right mind would suggest that New Yorkers should go back to work tomorrow,” Cruz said, referring to the nation’s epicenter of the crisis, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-cases-news-update.html">more than 12,000 people have died of COVID-19</a>, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.</p>\n<p>But, Cruz added, “There are parts of the country where the numbers are not nearly as bad.”</p>\n<p>The states should implement plans to protect the most vulnerable from COVID-19 — the elderly and people with serious health conditions, Cruz said.</p>\n<figure>\n <img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/890b0760-80ec-11ea-af1f-a5609e97dac8" alt="Ted Cruz speaks to Yahoo FInance" credit="Yahoo Finance" crediturl="" width="1500" height="843" data-ops=""> \n <figcaption>\n  Ted Cruz speaks to Yahoo FInance\n </figcaption> \n</img></figure>\n<p>But Cruz says as much should be done as possible to “allow young healthy people to go back to work and to do so in ways that are safe, maybe using PPE [personal protective equipment], using masks and gloves and maybe using social distancing.” Cruz says the decision to reopen should be made at the local level. “It’s got to vary based on the circumstances on the ground,” he said.</p>\n<h2>Safely kick-starting the US economy</h2>\n<p>Stocks rose Friday after President Donald Trump outlined a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-european-stocks-rise-as-trump-unveils-plan-to-reopen-us-states-074142582.html">three phase approach to reopen the economy</a> while acknowledging the ultimate decision lies with each state’s governors. But the president went on a Twitter attack against Democratic governors in states like Virginia, Minnesota, and Michigan where Trump supporters have staged protests demanding governors reopen and rescind orders to stay at home.</p>\n<span> \n <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n  <p>LIBERATE MICHIGAN!</p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) \n  <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169217531056130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 17, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> </span>\n<p>“Our objective needs to protect the most lives possible,” Cruz said on Friday. He has proposed priorities for states to consider reopening such as stocking protective gear for medical staff and confirming adequate hospital capacity. The most important priority, Cruz says, is wide-spread testing — although it will take months to produce the millions of tests needed for the U.S.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Trump tweeted Friday that the states “have to step up their testing.” But governors like New York’s Andrew Cuomo have criticized the Trump administration for failing to rapidly scale up testing in the U.S. as other countries like South Korea did when COVID-19 first became a threat.</p>\n<span> \n <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n  <p>Large-scale testing is a massive undertaking.<br><br>We need the private sector to work with government to meet this enormous challenge.<br><br>And we need the federal government to act.</br></br></br></br></p>— Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) \n  <a href="https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1251176206101286912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 17, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> </span>\n<p>Still, Vice President Mike Pence has been talking to Abbott Laboratories <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ABT?p=ABT&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch">(ABT) </a>about producing its rapid response test <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/healthcare/rapid-coronavirus-test-from-abbott-labs-approved-by-the-fda">approved by the FDA last month</a>, Cruz pointed out. The Texas senator says the desperately needed tests are necessary to let people start working again.</p>\n<p>“And one of the things the vice president said this morning in the call is that they are expecting that by the end of the month, that we will be producing 20 million antibody tests a month,” Cruz said.</p>\n<p>Cruz didn’t say if the federal government or individual states would have to pay for the tests, and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer recently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.today.com/video/michigan-governor-talks-reopening-the-state-and-vice-president-speculation-82064965862">told NBC News</a>&nbsp;her state would need assistance from the federal government to create robust testing. Cruz suggested that it could be complicated to produce the necessary level of testing, though.</p>\n<p>“There is not a magic wand that that you can suddenly have hundreds of millions or billions of tests poof into existence,” Cruz said. It’s one of the reasons he has urged the administration to use the Defense Production Act to compel companies like Abbott to produce the tests.</p>\n<p>“That being said it is not the case that you\'ve got to have 300 million tests for 300 million Americans,” Cruz said. “We have people working now in all sorts of essential industries.” Cruz said states and businesses can be prudent about letting people get back to work until a sufficient number of tests are produced.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Adam Shapiro is co-anchor of Yahoo Finance’s On the Move.</strong></em></p>\n<ul> \n <li><p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jj-coronavirus-vaccine-we-plan-to-begin-production-at-risk-imminently-210204457.html">J&amp;J eyes \'imminent\' coronavirus vaccine production, aims for a billion doses worldwide</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gary-cohn-restarting-economy-after-coronavirus-not-going-to-be-an-overnight-big-bang-204735941.html">Gary Cohn: Restarting the economy after coronavirus is \'not going to be an overnight big bang\'</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/desperately-needed-medical-supplies-now-heading-to-us-to-fight-coronavirus-124519527.html">Desperately needed medical supplies to fight coronavirus are now heading to US</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airlines-plot-course-through-turbulent-coronavirus-crisis-with-billions-from-us-taxpayers-204853430.html">Airlines plot course through turbulent coronavirus crisis with billions from US taxpayers</a><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/johnson-johnson-chief-scientific-officer-predicts-coronavirus-vaccination-within-12-months-225714803.html">J&amp;J\'s Chief</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/johnson-johnson-chief-scientific-officer-predicts-coronavirus-vaccination-within-12-months-225714803.html">Scientific Officer predicts vaccinations against coronavirus within 12 months</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airline-ceos-promise-to-eliminate-dividends-and-stock-buybacks-if-congress-passes-29-b-coronavirus-bailout-175925540.html">Airline CEOs promise to eliminate dividends and stock buybacks if Congress passes $29B coronavirus bailout</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airlines-scramble-as-coronavirus-causes-revenue-to-plummet-120803293.html">Airlines scramble as coronavirus causes revenue to plummet</a></p></li> \n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Follow Yahoo Finance on&nbsp;</strong></em><a href="https://twitter.com/YahooFinance"><em><strong>Twitter</strong></em></a><em><strong>,&nbsp;</strong></em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/yahoofinance/"><em><strong>Facebook</strong></em></a><em><strong>,&nbsp;</strong></em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/yahoofinance/?hl=en"><em><strong>Instagram</strong></em></a><em><strong>,&nbsp;</strong></em><a href="https://flipboard.com/topic/yahoofinance"><em><strong>Flipboard</strong></em></a><em><strong>,&nbsp;</strong></em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/yahoo-finance"><em><strong>LinkedIn</strong></em></a><em><strong>,</strong></em><a href="http://youtube.com/c/yahoofinance?sub_confirmation=1">&nbsp;<em><strong>YouTube</strong></em></a><em><strong>, and&nbsp;</strong></em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yahoofinance/"><em><strong>reddit</strong></em></a></p>\n<p></p>',

          '\n<p>Procter &amp; Gamble’s <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/procter-gamble-pg-tops-q3-121512352.html">sales rose 10% in its third quarter</a>, which ended in March, thanks to American consumers stocking up on staples like toilet paper heading into the coronavirus lockdown. That suggests that in April, as the pandemic continues and such products continue to be scarce from local grocery stores, P&amp;G is one of the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stay-home-stocks-soar-wall-165706086.html">“stay at home” names</a> likely to benefit even more in April than it did in March.</p>\n<p>But many small businesses are seeing the inverse effect: April is going to be much worse financially than March.</p>\n<p>Most U.S. states didn’t begin issuing stay-at-home orders until mid-March, so many businesses really only experienced two big down weeks for the month. With some states now extending their stay-at-home orders through May 15, April will be the first full month of social distancing and non-essential business closures. (Another <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-covid-weekly-initial-jobless-claims-april-11-192401571.html">5.245 million Americans filed for unemployment</a> for the week ending April 11.)</p>\n<p>That’s why adding more funding to the government’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for small-business loans is so essential. (The <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/349-billion-ppp-coronavirus-loan-program-for-small-businesses-runs-out-of-money-in-13-days-143606277.html">initial $349 billion allotment ran out on Thursday morning</a>.) Many of the small businesses that need the most help didn’t get through in the first round, says OceanFirst Bank CEO Christopher Maher.</p>\n<p>“The businesses that were earliest to apply... had the advantages of accountants and attorneys and advisors,” Maher told Yahoo Finance on Friday. “We need more money because the folks that didn’t get through are disproportionately those smallest businesses. They are in some cases minority- and women-owned businesses, and they simply didn’t have the resources or the advice to get in early.”</p>\n<p>New Jersey-based OceanFirst got $350 million worth of PPP loans approved by the SBA and has sent $200 million of that out the door, Maher says, but the bank still has another $200 million worth of requests that didn’t get through.</p>\n<p>Maher added that many OceanFirst clients “had a pretty good March. It really didn’t start to hurt them until April, and they didn’t jump on this program as quickly as they could have.”</p>\n<figure>\n <img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-04/c8d1e980-80d9-11ea-bffb-9f3b5280831b" alt="WELLESLEY, MA - APRIL 15: Taylor true value rental equipment store in Wellesley, MA thanks their customers for support on April 14, 2020.

It’s April that looks brutal.</p>\n<p>Comm-Fit, for example, which sells and installs fitness equipment to corporate clients in Texas, saw a 20% sales dip for March—bad, but not devastating—because it had existing contracts in place for deliveries in March. For April, Comm-Fit CEO Seth Gordon says his sales will be down by more than 75%: “Obviously, the commercial customer is shut down right now.” <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-small-business-owners-who-received-ppp-coronavirus-loan-funds-all-used-small-banks-180943179.html">Comm-Fit received a $412,000 PPP loan</a>, but Gordon says, “If this becomes a six-month or 12-month or 18-month issue, this money will only last so long.”</p>\n<p>Similarly, Gold Coast Pet Care, a dog-walking business in New Jersey, told Yahoo Finance it still had some clients paying for dog walks in March, but after a few weeks of quarantining, customers went dry, “as things have gotten more scary,” co-owner Josh Klein said.</p>\n<p>Gold Coast applied for a PPP loan through Chase on April 8 and didn’t hear back until April 17, when Chase emailed to say that the first round of funds is gone and customers who got a loan approved were already notified.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p><strong>Daniel Roberts is an editor-at-large at Yahoo Finance.

          '\n<p>President Trump did a couple of things right this week. He backed a coherent if better-late-than-never federal <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/">plan for reopening the economy</a>, which is largely shuttered due to the coronavirus pandemic. And he deferred to governors who are the ultimate deciders in terms of what reopens and what stays closed.</p>\n<p>But Trump undermined these passing moments of sensibility by stoking outrage in a handful of states struggling with high infection rates and economic damage. On April 17, <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/bleak-figures-china-us-show-055947073.html">Trump posted a series</a> of tweets urging protesters to “LIBERATE” Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia. It was essentially a war whoop for stupid people who think it’s better for everybody to get the virus than to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-lockdown-175223869.html">shut down businesses</a> for a while. Protestors have already put on an imbecility display in Michigan, where they’ve bunched together at the state capital in a show of defiance to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-michigan/michigan-residents-sue-governor-whitmer-over-coronavirus-pandemic-orders-idUSKCN21Y2IG">Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s stay-at-home order</a>. Trump is essentially fomenting rebellion in swing states with Democratic governors that are crucial to the 2020 presidential election.</p>\n<figure>\n <img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-04/b1cc6430-7f68-11ea-9ffb-0bad65a455d4" alt="A passenger in a vehicle holds a sign during a protest at the State Capitol in Lansing, Mich., Wednesday, April 15, 2020.

And some people are undoubtedly dumb enough to do it, unaware that Trump is using them as virus fodder. Trump’s message is “don’t worry about getting sick, just attack my political enemies for me.” It seems inevitable there will be karmic moments in which Trump’s foot soldiers catch the virus and perhaps even die. Trump will be fine, though, safe in the White House or on one of his golf courses. So it’s all good.</p>\n<p>Trump’s reopening plan, judged on its merits, would have rated an improvement over last week’s FAILING score on the Trump-o-meter. But there’s only one possible Trump-o-meter score for encouraging gullible people to charge head-on into a virus cloud: SAD.</p>\n<figure>\n <img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-03/92bfc860-6551-11ea-bdee-99f2930e4f65" alt="Source: Yahoo Finance" credit="Source: Yahoo Finance" crediturl="" width="2037" height="2072" data-ops=""> \n <figcaption>\n  Source: Yahoo Finance\n </figcaption> \n</img></figure>\n<p>Trump’s reopening plan, for what it’s worth, is a major improvement over his previous calls to open by some calendar date, such as Easter. There are no reopening dates now, which is a prerequisite for any credible plan, since calendar dates are irrelevant to a virus that remains prevalent throughout the world. Instead, the Trump plan establishes “gates” states and municipalities must pass through in order to gradually send people back to work in a phased manner that can be reversed if the virus flares up again.</p>\n<p>These gating benchmarks set an appropriately high bar reopening businesses. “The gating criteria is more restrictive than one might realize,” financial firm Raymond James explained in an analysis of the plan. “We cannot think of a single state that can seriously claim they meet the ‘core state preparedness responsibilities’ at this time.”</p>\n<p>The plan entails three phases, ranging from very limited movement to free movement for low-risk people and normal staffing at workplaces. To enter each phase, a state or region must have data showing an uninterrupted decline in coronavirus cases for 14 continuous days. If there’s a single day of increase during that time, the clock restarts.</p>\n<p>Under the best scenario, it would take three 14-day periods—42 days—to go from a stay-at-home regime to phase 3. For the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-stay-at-home-order.html">40-something states with stay-home orders</a>, that means June is the earliest for some semblance of normalcy to return. And even that is probably unlikely, given testing shortages and other gaps.</p>\n<figure>\n <img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/83480290-80b2-11ea-badb-1e4280993e1c" alt="Coronavirus cases are on the rise.

Yet another necessity—massive <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-update-us-sketches-out-economys-reopen-but-testing-a-big-worry-182002455.html">scale-ups in testing</a>—is missing from Trump’s plan. Trump seems to have a blind spot on testing. He has said repeatedly it’s going fine despite massive shortages, and even now he fails to acknowledge how far behind the United States is.</p>\n<p>Still, what’s the point of any federal plan if the president tells people to disregard it? Governors have the final say, and they’re in the process of establishing their own criteria for a slow return to normal. Trump’s subversiveness will undoubtedly make it harder for governors trying to balance the risk of ongoing waves of infection against the economic damage caused by a prolonged shutdown.</p>\n<p>There’s wide agreement that the worst outcome would be recurring waves of infection caused by removing precautions too quickly. That would add new stress to overwhelmed hospitals, bring on more preventable deaths, force new rounds of business closures and prolong what is already sure to be a painful <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-q1-earnings-during-covid19-pandemic-111708844.html">recession</a>. Yet that’s what Trump is asking for.</p>\n<p>Chaos always emerges from order in the Trump administration. Before Trump began calling for swing-state rebellion, he declared supreme power over governors that he doesn’t actually have. He put a hold on funding for the World Health Organization, which is like gutting the budget for the fire department while your house is burning. And Trump now insists it’s the governors’ job, not his, to ramp up testing. If the president’s only job is to encourage people to defy their governors, why have a president at all?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Rick Newman is the author of four books, including “</strong></em><a href="https://www.rickjnewman.com/"><strong>Rebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success</strong></a><em><strong>.” Follow him on Twitter:&nbsp;</strong></em><a href="https://twitter.com/rickjnewman"><em><strong>@rickjnewman</strong></em></a><em><strong>.
